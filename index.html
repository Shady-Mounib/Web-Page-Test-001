        <p>Hey There! This is my first web site where I'm trying to practice all
          the skills that I have learned and expand my skills further more through
          continous learning and practice.<br>
          I've learned many programing languages until now, but I'm still at the basic
          or beginner level in all of them.<br>
          These languages include:
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
          </ul>
          I've also learned some tools that can help me manage my future projects
          like version control tools including <em>git</em> & <em>github</em>. <br>
          And now, I'm trying to practice using all of them together in this project. <br>
